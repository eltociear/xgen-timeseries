# About Us

We are a team of researchers and engineers dedicated to advancing the field of energy analysis and data-driven solutions. Our mission is to develop innovative approaches for fine-grained analysis of energy consumption and contribute to building a sustainable future.

At the core of our work is the development of a curated dataset called XGen-ESS (Energy System Science). This dataset is designed to provide comprehensive and high-resolution information about energy consumption patterns, device behavior, and the quality of electrical mains. XGen-ESS aims to empower researchers, data scientists, and industry professionals with valuable insights to drive advancements in energy efficiency, demand-side management, and grid optimization.

To ensure the accessibility and reproducibility of our research, we have made the XGen Time Series archive available. This archive contains a wealth of time-series data collected from various smart plugs and sensors deployed in different residential and commercial settings. By sharing this dataset, we encourage collaboration and invite researchers and practitioners to explore and analyze the data to gain deeper insights into energy consumption patterns and develop innovative solutions.


The XGen Time Series archive can be accessed [here](/archive/index.html). We encourage researchers and users to leverage this valuable resource and contribute to the advancement of energy analysis and management.

As a team, we are committed to driving meaningful impact in the energy domain through our research, collaborations, and the development of data-driven solutions. We actively seek opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations to address the pressing challenges of energy sustainability and efficiency.


If you are interested in our work, have any questions, or would like to explore collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out to us. Together, we can make a significant difference in shaping a sustainable energy future.

Please note that the link provided to the XGen Time Series archive is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual link to the archive.
